Games today are massive ecosystems - combining players, servers, social interactions, vritual economies, and even sports-level competition. The OWASP Game Security Framework (GSF) is your go-to resource for understanding how attackers exploit these systems and how developers can fight back. By providing threat models, real-world case studies, and practical strategies, the GSF equips you to root out vulnerabilities and keep games fair, secure, and most of all - fun.

## Deliverables

1. Game Security Playbook
        Guidance on secure game development, cheat prevention, and best practices for protecting game ecosystems.
2. Threat Models
        Focused models addressing multiplayer exploits, client integrity, and server vulnerabilities to help identify and mitigate risks.
3. Game Security Checklist
        A practical checklist to ensure foundational security practices during development and deployment.
4. Cheat & Exploit Taxonomy
        A list of common cheats, vulnerabilities, and their mechanisms to assist in detection and prevention efforts.
5. Case Studies
        Real-world examples of game security incidents and mitigation strategies to learn from past challenges.
